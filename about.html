            <h1><strong>Director’s Statement</strong></h1>
            <div id="statement">
                <p>Growing up as a teen in this digital era, I experienced everything in social media. From getting
                    compliments to getting cyber bullied. I directed this film, Forbidden Fruit, after realizing one
                    morning
                    that I’m too dependent on social media. I want the viewers to open their eyes and refresh themselves
                    that we are more than who we are online. I was inspired by coming-of-age films since they give us
                    comfort that we are not alone in those certain situations.
                </p>
                <p>Most of us had those experiences, where we were overwhelmed with social media interactions and
                    knowledge
                    in social media are gathered by personal experiences. That is the film's point: to take a break from
                    the
                    internet and appreciate life more. Working with this crew was enjoyable because we all knew what we
                    were
                    doing and each of us had our own specialties. One major challenge was shooting during a pandemic;
                    some
                    of my crew members became ill, which lead me to push through with the film lacking a few members. I
                    chose black and white to represent the digital versions of ourselves, which will never be our true
                    selves. I also used a 4:3 aspect ratio to give the impression of being cornered or bounded. Making
                    this
                    film helped me deal with the struggles I encountered years ago.
